      <!-- Main Story -->
      <section class="intro">
        <p class="intro-text">
          I'm a developer who fell in love with photography, and a photographer
          who can't stop coding. I spend my days building web applications that
          solve real problems and my evenings chasing perfect light with a
          camera. Sometimes these worlds collide in the most beautiful ways.
        </p>

      <!-- The Story -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">How I Got Here</h2>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            It started with a simple problem: I had thousands of photos
            scattered across different devices and needed a way to organize
            them. Instead of buying software, I decided to build my own. That
            first Python script opened my eyes to how code could enhance
            creativity rather than replace it.
          </p>

          <p>
            While studying computer science, I picked up my first real camera –
            a used Fujifilm X-T2. The precision required in photography reminded
            me of programming: every setting matters, composition follows rules
            (that can be broken), and the difference between good and great
            often lies in the details most people never notice.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, I work as a full-stack developer by day and shoot portraits,
            events, and street photography by night and weekends. But the real
            magic happens when these worlds intersect – building tools for
            photographers, creating web experiences that showcase visual work
            beautifully, or using code to push the boundaries of digital art.

              I build web applications with React, Node.js, and Python. I love
              creating tools that help creative professionals manage their work
              – portfolio sites, client galleries, booking systems, and image
              processing APIs.

              I specialize in portrait and event photography, with a focus on

            <h4>Details Matter</h4>
            <p>
              Whether it's pixel-perfect UI components or perfectly exposed
              photos, I believe excellence lives in the details that most people
              never consciously notice.

            <h4>Tools Should Disappear</h4>
            <p>
              The best technology gets out of the way and lets people focus on
              what they're creating. I build interfaces that feel intuitive and
              cameras that become extensions of vision.

            <h4>Always Learning</h4>
            <p>
              Both fields evolve constantly. I read code, study other
              photographers' work, experiment with new techniques, and stay
              curious about what's possible.

            <h4>Human-Centered</h4>

              Technology should amplify human creativity, not replace it. Every
              project I work on starts with understanding the people who will
              use it.
