      <!-- Main Story -->
      <section class="intro">
        <p class="intro-text">
          I'm an IT student at Singapore Polytechnic with a passion for software
          engineering and technology innovation. I'm currently pursuing my
          Diploma in Information Technology while making an internship at
          immersive research lab. My goal is to help technological innovations
          and build solutions that make a meaningful impact.

          <p>
            My journey into tech began with curiosity about how computing
            systems work and a desire to create solutions that matter. The
            biggest inspirations for technology is Lewis from the animation
            movie "Meet the Robinsons", and Tony Stark from Marvel movie "Iron
            Man". Their healthy influence make me do a determination to follow
            the path your heart desires and there is no limit to give love and
            help to everyone.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Singapore Polytechnic, I got more time to kept in touch with web
            development and software developing architecture. I also spend some
            time on completing online courses and certificates, as secondary
            learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am working on setting my goals and career paths.
            Eventhough I'm can't see what the future holds, I'm still trying to
            make the best out of it.

            <li>
              The confusion between "Why this code work" and "Why this code
              doesn't work" is the same for me.
            </li>
            <li>
              I do believe that aliens are real, but I also believe that they
              are just human beings.
            </li>

            <li>
              I still don't know how to undo the last commit with no conflict
              and I don't mind that.
            </li>

            <li>
              I promised myself to do proper playlists countless times but I
              currently have 977 songs in my "Liked Music" Auto Playlist.
            </li>
            <li>
              The most "WTF" moment in my life was when I found out I have a
              Stellium with Quadruple Aquarius.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was 12 when I met my first love. When my mom found out about us,
              I remember seeing her cry for what felt like forever.
            </li>
            <li>
              In my family, I am the only one who doesn't like durian (I tried,
              but failed).
            </li>
            <li>
              Sometime, I look back the version of me from years ago, and I
              whisper "You are so awesome".
