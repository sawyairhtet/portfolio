      <!-- Main Story -->
      <section class="intro">
        <p class="intro-text">
          I'm an IT student at Singapore Polytechnic with a passion for software
          engineering and technology innovation. I'm currently pursuing my
          Diploma in Information Technology while gaining real-world experience
          through part-time work. My goal is to connect the dots of
          technological innovations and build solutions that make a meaningful
          impact.

      <!-- The Story -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">How I Got Here</h2>

        <div class="story-content">
          <p>
            My journey into technology began with curiosity about how digital
            systems work and a desire to create solutions that matter. After
            completing high school, I knew I wanted to pursue a career that
            combines logical thinking with creative problem-solving, leading me
            to Information Technology.
          </p>

          <p>
            At Singapore Polytechnic, I'm developing skills in software
            development, database management, and responsive web design. The
            precision required in programming appeals to me – every line of code
            matters, structure follows logical patterns, and the difference
            between good and great software often lies in the details most users
            never see.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I balance my studies with part-time work at Capella
            Hotel, where I've learned valuable communication and interpersonal
            skills. This experience has taught me the importance of user
            experience and customer service – principles I apply to my approach
            to software development and technology solutions.

            <h3>Responsive Web Design</h3>
            <p>
              I'm developing expertise in creating modern, responsive websites
              that work seamlessly across all devices. I focus on clean code,
              user experience, and performance optimization using the latest web
              technologies.

            <p>
              Learning to design, implement, and optimize databases for various
              applications. I'm studying SQL, database normalization, and
              working with relational database management systems to create
              efficient data solutions.

            <h4>Details Matter</h4>
            <p>
              Whether it's clean code structure or efficient database design, I
              believe excellence lives in the details that make software
              reliable and maintainable for the long term.

              Technology evolves rapidly, and I stay curious about new
              developments. I read documentation, study best practices,
              experiment with new tools, and learn from the broader developer
              community.
